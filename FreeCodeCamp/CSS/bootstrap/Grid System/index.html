                            Soon the freeCodeCamp curriculum will be 100% project-driven learning. Instead of a series
                            of coding
                            challenges, you'll learn through building projects - step by step. Before we get into the
                            details,
                            let me emphasize: we are not changing the certifications. All 6 certifications will still
                            have the
                            same 5 required projects. We are only changing the optional coding challenges.

                            After years - years - of pondering these two problems and how to solve them, I slipped, hit
                            my head
                            on the sink, and when I came to I had a revelation! A vision! A picture in my head! A
                            picture of
                            this! This is what makes time travel possible: the flux capacitor!

                            It wasn't as dramatic as Doc's revelation in Back to the Future. It just occurred to me
                            while I was
                            going for a run. The revelation: the entire curriculum should be a
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-md-6">
                            series of projects. Instead of individual coding challenges, we'll just have projects, each
                            with
                            their own seamless series of tests. Each test gives you just enough information to figure
                            out how to
                            get it to pass. (And you can view hints if that isn't enough.)

                            <span>" The entire curriculum should be a series of projects "</span>
                            <hr>
                            No more walls of explanatory text. No more walls of tests. Just one test at a time, as you
                            build up
                            a working project. Over the course of passing thousands of tests, you build up projects and
                            your own
                            understanding of coding fundamentals. There is no transition between lessons and projects,
                            because
                            the lessons themselves are baked into projects.
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6">
                    And there's plenty of repetition to help you retain everything because - hey - building projects in
                    real life has plenty of repetition.

                    The main design challenge is taking what is currently paragraphs of explanation and instructions and
                    packing them into a single test description text. Each project will involve dozens of tests like
                    this. People will be coding the entire time, rather than switching back and forth from "reading
                    mode" to "coding mode".

                    Instead of a series of coding challenges, people will be in their code editor passing one test after
                    another, quickly building up a project. People will get into a real flow state, similar to what they
                    experience when they build the required projects at the end of each certification. They'll get that
                    sense of forward progress right from the beginning. And freeCodeCamp will be a much smoother
                    experience.
